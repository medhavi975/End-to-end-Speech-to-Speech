# End-to-end-Speech-to-Speech

 This project involves the development of an end-to-end speech recognition system that converts audio files into text using Python-based libraries like speech_recognition and pydub. The system processes large audio files by splitting them into manageable chunks, especially during silent intervals, to enhance recognition accuracy. It employs Google's speech recognition API for transcribing the segmented audio, making it a practical solution for converting spoken language into written text. The project aims to facilitate efficient and accurate transcription of lengthy audio recordings in real-world applications.
